# Old North Port

Before the deluge of the second century, the Dosk River delta was only a shallow bog surrounding a coal mining settlement.
Ships used the Old North Port to dock and re-supply before crossing the open sea to Skovlan.
The obsolete port was abandoned to the Death Lands when the second lightning barrier was built.
