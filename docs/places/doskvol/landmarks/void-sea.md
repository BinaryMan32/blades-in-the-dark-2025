# Void Sea

During the cataclysm, the oceans turned to black ink.
Tiny points of light, arrayed like constellations of stars, can be seen far below the surface.
Only the bravest or most desperate of captains dare to sail beyond sight of land, into a sea as black and dark as the sky above.
The vengeful ghosts which plague the land tend to shun the open ocean, but there are more terrible things prowling the deeps.
