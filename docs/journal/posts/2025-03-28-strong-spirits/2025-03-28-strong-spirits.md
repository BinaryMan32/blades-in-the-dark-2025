# Strong Spirits

We're at war with the [Spirit Wardens](spirit-wardens.md) and trying to find a way to end it.

<!-- more -->

The [Spirit Wardens](spirit-wardens.md) have quite a few enemies, but they're all pretty strong.

{{ characters.vesper.link }} has a prostitute friend who works with high end clientele.
She will see what she can find out about them.

Maybe we can improve relations by dealing with a troublesome spirit?
We can force a spirit into a spirit bottle using a spiritbane charm.
We talk to Fitz and are able to borrow one.

We travel to the edge of the city where {{ characters.jb.link }} can get us through the barrier keeping spirits out into the [Death Lands](death-lands.md).

## Plan

- **Plan:** Transport
- **Detail:** go outside the barrier to get a spirit and put it in the bottle, then take it to Bellweather Crematorium
- **Engagement Roll:** {{ d6_rolls([1, 2, 2]) }}
