# The Last Dregs

![Ghostfang Pack Host a Party](./ghostfang-pack-party.png)
/// caption
The [Ghostfang Pack](ghostfang-pack.md) hosted a party in [Whitecrown](whitecrown.md).
///

[Lady Freyla](lady-freyla.md) was one of the richest to attend.
At first, [Bella's Boyz](bellas-boyz.md) considered stealing some of her legendary wine collection.
Then, one of her competitors offered a substantial reward to ruin her reputation instead.

After the party, the [Ghostfang Pack](ghostfang-pack.md) is too bit hung over to help with the score.
///

[Bella's Boyz](bellas-boyz.md) have a surprising number of connections to [Lady Freyla](lady-freyla.md):

- She testified against {{ characters.vesper.link }}.
- She beat {{ characters.hex.link }} in a sommolier competition at Da Club and he wants revenge.
- She's rumored to have a bottle of wine that {{ characters.echo.link }}'s spurned lover desires: Velorium Sanctum â€“ "Sunless Bloom" Icewine
- She is {{ characters.jb.link }}'s former girlfriend

{{ characters.hex.link }} is at Da Club, talking to the bartender about fine wines.
He convinces the bartender to let him sample a small glass of Le Mongoose.
It's an extremely expensive wine, even samples cost `$5/ml`.

The bartender mentions a buyer is coming later to pick up the cask of Le Mongoose, worth {{ coin(100) }}.
The buyer is a competitor of [Lady Freyla](lady-freyla.md).
Some time later, {{ characters.vesper.link }} sees a man approach with high collar and hood.
Vesper bumps into him.
"Careful, this is very expensive!"

![Vesper and the Wine Buyer](./vesper-wine-contact.png)

{{ characters.vesper.link }} and the Wine Buyer
///

Vesper thinks the buyer looks vaguely familiar.
The buyer mentions that it would be a shame if [Lady Freyla](lady-freyla.md) lost the next sommolier competition.
Vesper offers to remove a competing wine from [Lady Freyla](lady-freyla.md)'s collection.
The buyer offers {{ coin(40) }} for us to ruin her best wine without leaving a trace.
If we're detected, we will get only {{ coin(10) }}.
The buyer offers to have someone meet us at Da Club to help with changing the wine's flavor profile.

[Bella's Boyz](bellas-boyz.md) meet [Frenchy](frenchy.md)
///

[Bella's Boyz](bellas-boyz.md) are introduced to [Frenchy](frenchy.md), the wine fixer.
He says it will be much easier to alter the wine instead of swapping whole bottles.
[Frenchy](frenchy.md) pulls out a long needle and waves it around.
He wants to use this syringe to inject something into [Lady Freyla](lady-freyla.md)'s expensive wines.
We need to get him into the wine cellar, but we're a bit nervous about how conspicuous he is with waving the syringe around.
