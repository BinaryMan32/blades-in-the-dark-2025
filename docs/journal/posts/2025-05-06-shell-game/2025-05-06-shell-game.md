# Shell Game

We're looking for something small and expensive that we can steal.
[Rolan Wott](rolan-wott.md) will be hosting a party soon for his daughter's 16th birthday.
His prized possession is a Fabergé egg.
[Bella's Boyz](bellas-boyz.md) go to see [Fitz](fitz.md) for tools and materials, and {{ characters.jackal.link }} makes a replica of the egg.

Commander Bowmore might be at this party ({{ characters.jackal.link }} wants to sabotoge the government).

{{ characters.vesper.link }} gets his name on the list of party attendees.
[Jennah](jennah.md) helps everyone else pose as servants for the party.

    - `+1` the operation is bold and daring
    - `+1` {{ characters.vesper.link }} confronting [Rolan Wott](rolan-wott.md) hits him where he's weakest

    - `-1` due to heavy [Blue Coats](blue-coats.md) presence in [Brightstone](brightstone.md)

{{ characters.vesper.link }} shows up late due to clothing difficulties.
