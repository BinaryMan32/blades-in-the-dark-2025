# Terrible Turf Acquisition

[Bella's Boys](bellas-boys.md) are looking to acquire more turf.
They're eyeing some nearby territory controlled by the [Fog Hounds](fog-hounds.md) in [The Docks](docks.md).

<!-- more -->

{{ characters.vesper.link }} asks Zarak and Ash if they know anything about the [Fog Hounds](fog-hounds.md).
{{ characters.vesper.link }} knows a prostitute named [Nyryx](nyryx.md) who has some info on everyone.
{{ characters.jackal.link }}'s rival [Eckerd](eckerd.md) is nearby in [Brightstone](brightstone.md) smuggling corpses.
[Eckerd](eckerd.md) spots [Nyryx](nyryx.md) and interrupts her investigations, negating any benefits.
The [Fog Hounds](fog-hounds.md) are busy with a smuggling operation which draws some of them away from their lair.

## Plan

- **Plan:** Occult
- **Detail:** works with Zarak and Ash
- **Engagement Roll:** {{ d6_rolls([4, 1, 3]) }}
