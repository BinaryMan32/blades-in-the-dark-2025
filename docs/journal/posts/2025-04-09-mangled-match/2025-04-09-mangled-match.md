# The Mangled Match

[Bella's Boyz](bellas-boyz.md) are looking for another claim to expand our territory.
we took a claim in the docks from the foghounds before.
The [Gray Cloaks](gray-cloaks.md) operate mostly in [Charterhall](charterhall.md).
We hear [Lord Strangford](lord-strangford.md) is willing to pay for evidence the [Gray Cloaks](gray-cloaks.md) stole from the [Blue Coats](blue-coats.md).

<!-- more -->

- {{ characters.echo.link }} receives a letter demanding {{ coin(1) }}
    - {{ characters.echo.link }} pays
    - the rest of the crew don't press him to explain
- [Jeren](jeren.md) is able to give us a tip on how to find the [Gray Cloaks](gray-cloaks.md) and where the evidence might be hidden
    - look for [Schlomo](schlomo.md) at the fight
- [Nyryx](nyryx.md) finds out about a bare-knuckle boxing match that we could use as a distraction
    - [Nyryx](nyryx.md) asks {{ characters.vesper.link }} not to come to her with something so low-brow in the future

## Plan

- **Plan:** **Social**
- **Detail:** [Jeren](jeren.md) helps us find the evidence
- **Engagement Roll:** {{ d6_rolls([6, 3, 3]) }}
    - bold, daring since there are many [Gray Cloaks](gray-cloaks.md) at the party

## Score

- there are 2 big bouncers at the door
    - we make it inside without anyone noticing
