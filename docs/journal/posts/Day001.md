# New Crew in Doskvol

## Setup
- we're in the office of [Bazoes](bazoes.md), leader of [The Lampblacks](lampblacks.md)
- [Bella's Boys](bellas-boys.md) stole the trainer from [The Lampblacks](lampblacks.md)
- [Bazoes](bazoes.md) is wary of us establing a hideout in his territory
  - wants to see if we'll do a mission for him to determine if we're trustworthy
  - Bassos will tell us the location of the [Red Sashes](red-sashes.md) treasury
  - the treasury has `12` coin, Bassos will keep `2` and we take `10`
  - treasury is in [Crow's Foot](crows-foot.md)
- go to red sash sword academy
  - headquarters of the [Red Sashes](red-sashes.md)

## Plan
- choose **Occult** plan with a detail of using the ghost field
- [Carrin's](carrin-mercer.md) friend [Celia](celia.md) tries to help with ghosts
- there's a party, the place is busy tonight
- before arriving, we followed some people and stole their invitations (1 stress for [Hex](willem-cash.md))

## Score
- we approach the doors with our invitations
- they let us in, there are people everywhere
  - lots of drugs around
- [Vesper](carrin-mercer.md) finds a ghost of a little girl playing with a head in her hands
  - there's coin everywhere in here
  - Vesper: let's play a game where we find some coins
    - tries to pretend he's on drugs instead of talking to himself
  - one of the [Red Sashes](red-sashes.md) comes over and offers some [Blood Needle](blood-needle.md)
    - stabs [Vesper](carrin-mercer.md) 6 times
  - [Vesper](carrin-mercer.md) runs off following the girl
- everyone but [Hex](willem-cash.md) runs after
- there's an orgy going on in the room where there's coin hidden under the floorboards
  - [Vesper] and [JB] join in the orgy
- [Echo] uses knowledge of the blueprints to find the room underneath
  - door to the room is locked
- [Jackal] tries to break in
- [Echo] barged into another room at the same time to disguise the noise
  - ends up joining in an orgy
- [Jackal] gets into the ceiling and starts digging around
  - leaves a 2 foot diameter hole in the ceiling
  - [Jackal] gets a reputation for wrecking places during parties
- [Vesper] and [JB] create a distraction with their amorous activities
  - distraction succeeds
  - it's a really weird position, too much for the others, and they clear out slowly
    - word spreads that [Vesper] is a sexual deviant
  - [Vesper] goes under the rug and easily pulls up the floorboards
    - sees [Jackal] through the floor below
    - [Jackal] motions for [Vesper] to take the `3` coin
    - [Vesper] cleans up afterwards
- [Jackal] sees a safe and works on it
  - gets in, but knows that he trips an alarm
  - chest inside has `6` coin
- [Echo] tries to get away from the orgy by pairing off with someone
  - gets away, but disappoints the companion that he left with
- [Jackal] and [Echo] take the heavy chest
- [Vesper] finds another door in the basement with guards
  - asks ghosts for help
  - turns away and the guards disembowel each other
  - spirits exit their bodies and they look at [Vesper]
    - from a devil's bargain, [Vesper] will be haunted
- [Vesper] enters the room
  - it's a drug den
  - lots of [Blood Needle] and [Spark]
  - takes another `3` coin

    - jams something in the door
    - we're in a garden that's walled off
- [Echo] persuaded a romantic encounter to give a secret entrance into the garden
