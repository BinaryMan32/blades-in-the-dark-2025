# New Crew in Doskvol

[Bella's Boys](bellas-boys.md) are in the office of [Bazoes](bazoes.md), leader of [The Lampblacks](lampblacks.md).
Our crew establed a hideout in his territory and stole the trainer from [The Lampblacks](lampblacks.md), making [Bazoes](bazoes.md) wary of us.
He wants to test us with a mission to see if we're trustworthy.
[Bazoes](bazoes.md) will provide the location of the [Red Sashes](red-sashes.md) treasury of {{ coin(12) }}.
He wants {{ coin(2) }} for the information, which leaves {{ coin(10) }} for us.

<!-- more -->

The treasury is in [Crow's Foot](crows-foot.md) in the red sash sword academy, headquarters of the [Red Sashes](red-sashes.md).

## Plan

- choose **Occult** plan with a detail of using the ghost field
- [Carrin's](carrin-mercer.md) friend [Celia](celia.md) tries to help with ghosts
- there's a party, the place is busy tonight
- before arriving, we followed some people and stole their invitations (1 stress for [Hex](willem-cash.md))

## Score

- we approach the doors with our invitations
- they let us in, there are people everywhere
  - lots of drugs around
- [Vesper](carrin-mercer.md) finds a ghost of a little girl playing with a head in her hands
  - there's coin everywhere in here
  - Vesper: let's play a game where we find some coins
    - tries to pretend he's on drugs instead of talking to himself
  - one of the [Red Sashes](red-sashes.md) comes over and offers some [Blood Needle](blood-needle.md)
    - stabs [Vesper](carrin-mercer.md) 6 times
  - [Vesper](carrin-mercer.md) runs off following the girl
- everyone but [Hex](willem-cash.md) runs after
- there's an orgy going on in the room where there's coin hidden under the floorboards
  - [Vesper] and [JB] join in the orgy
- [Echo] uses knowledge of the blueprints to find the room underneath
  - door to the room is locked
- [Jackal] tries to break in
- [Echo] barged into another room at the same time to disguise the noise
  - ends up joining in an orgy
- [Jackal] gets into the ceiling and starts digging around
  - leaves a 2 foot diameter hole in the ceiling
  - [Jackal] gets a reputation for wrecking places during parties
- [Vesper] and [JB] create a distraction with their amorous activities
  - distraction succeeds
  - it's a really weird position, too much for the others, and they clear out slowly
    - word spreads that [Vesper] is a sexual deviant
  - [Vesper] goes under the rug and easily pulls up the floorboards
    - sees [Jackal] through the floor below
    - [Jackal] motions for [Vesper] to take the {{ coin(3) }}
    - [Vesper] cleans up afterwards
- [Jackal] sees a safe and works on it
  - gets in, but knows that he trips an alarm
  - chest inside has {{ coin(6) }}
- [Echo] tries to get away from the orgy by pairing off with someone
  - gets away, but disappoints the companion that he left with
- [Jackal] and [Echo] take the heavy chest
- [Vesper] finds another door in the basement with guards
  - asks ghosts for help
  - turns away and the guards disembowel each other
  - spirits exit their bodies and they look at [Vesper]
    - from a devil's bargain, [Vesper] will be haunted
- [Vesper] enters the room
  - it's a drug den
  - lots of [Blood Needle](blood-needle.md) and [Spark](spark.md)
  - takes another {{ coin(3) }}
- we head to the front doors
  - group of [Red Sashes] are running with swords drawn, 100 ft away
  - [Echo] remembers another entrance from some blueprints
  - find a back door
  - [Hex] looks for some way to block the exit
    - jams something in the door
    - we're in a garden that's walled off
- [Echo] persuaded a romantic encounter to give a secret entrance into the garden
  - for a future meetup
