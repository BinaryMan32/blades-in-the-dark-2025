# New Crew in Doskvol

[Bella's Boys](bellas-boys.md) are in the office of [Bazoes](bazoes.md), leader of [The Lampblacks](lampblacks.md).
Our crew establed a hideout in his territory and stole the trainer from [The Lampblacks](lampblacks.md), making [Bazoes](bazoes.md) wary of us.
He wants to test us with a mission to see if we're trustworthy.
[Bazoes](bazoes.md) will provide the location of the [Red Sashes](red-sashes.md) treasury of {{ coin(12) }}.
He wants {{ coin(2) }} for the information, which leaves {{ coin(10) }} for us.

<!-- more -->

The treasury is in [Crow's Foot](crows-foot.md) in the red sash sword academy, headquarters of the [Red Sashes](red-sashes.md).
